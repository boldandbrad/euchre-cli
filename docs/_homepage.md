## About

Euchre is a trick taking game with a trump, played by four people in teams of two.

Each hand, one of the teams calls the trump suit and then attempts to take the
majority of tricks in that hand. Each player plays a single card, the highest played
card of the lead suit takes the trick, or the highest played card of the trump
suit, if one has been played. Play continues for several hands until a team has
been awarded a total of 10 points.
